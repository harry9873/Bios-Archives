The Epic Games Store is back with a weekly offer and you can pick up the Fallout 3: Game of the Year edition at no extra cost. This title adds to the long list of premium titles available for free on the digital game store. This routine made the store a capable competitor to Steam.

The highlight of the week is the Fallout 3 GOTY edition with additional bonuses in the form of Everland. Players must know how to use titles so as not to miss any offers.
